### 
## Command 运行命令 初次本地部署

在一台什么都没有安装的 Linux 机器上部署一个 React 应用通常需要以下步骤

安装 Node.js 和 npm: 首先，您需要安装 Node.js 和 npm，因为 React 应用是基于 Node.js 的。您可以从 Node.js 的官方网站下载适用于您的 Linux 发行版的安装包，或者使用包管理工具进行安装。

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

如果出现`?==`运算符报错
```shell
nvm use 18
```

下载安装依赖
```shell
npm install react-router-dom
npm install tailwindcss
npm install framer-motion
```

启动React应用
```shell
npm start
```

## 调用接口
访问
`http://localhost:3000/`

如果应用正常运行，应当能看到前端页面。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
